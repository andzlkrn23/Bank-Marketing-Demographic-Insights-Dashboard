**Exploring Ken's YouTube Channel Insights**

In the dynamic realm of YouTube, Ken's journey stood out significantly in 2020, marked by an impressive output of 113 videos. However, the momentum shifted in 2021, resulting in a reduced count of 47 videos. Delving into the metrics, intriguing revelations surfaced.

Take a glance at the distribution of CPM (Cost Per Mille, in USD). It's centered around $10, suggesting potential earnings per thousand views through ads. Yet, to grasp Ken's true earnings, RPM (Revenue Per Mille, in USD) is the key player. Given YouTube's share, an RPM of around $5 emerges as a more accurate reflection of his actual revenue.

Among the array of videos, a true champion emerges: "How I would Learn Data Science (if I Had to Start Over)" commands around 47k likes, solidifying its position as Ken's most viewed and applauded content. Notably, there's a strong correlation between views and the subscribers gained or lost. Interesting observations surface, like "Why I Quit Data Science" facing significant subscriber loss yet not appearing among the top subscribers gainedâ€”a testament to its polarizing nature.

Geographical mapping offers a revealing insight: the majority of Ken's YouTube traffic flows in from the United States (1,354,450 views) and India (1,155,510 views), accounting for the lion's share of his million total views.

**Recommendation:** A dash of collaboration could work wonders for Ken. With the Data Science community's rapid growth, teaming up with fellow YouTubers/Content Creators, especially through live sessions, could introduce his channel to fresh audiences, driving curiosity toward his archive and potentially boosting subscriptions.

*In essence,* this analysis offers a focused glimpse into select metrics. Different projects, audiences, and goals could demand a unique set of metrics. Expect potential refinements and updates in the future as I continue my exploration of YouTube analytics.
